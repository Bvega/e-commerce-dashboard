## 📦 Features

- Fetches product data from [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com)
- Models product structure using a custom `Product` class
- Calculates:
  - 💲 Discount amount
  - 🧾 Tax amount (standard 4.75%, 3% for groceries)
  - 🧮 Final price after discount and tax
- Handles API and runtime errors gracefully
- Follows clean and modular TypeScript architecture
